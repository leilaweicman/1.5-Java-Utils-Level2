# 1.5-Java-Utils-Level2

## üìÑ Description ‚Äì Exercise Statement

This project contains the solution to the following Java exercise:

### Exercise 1
Execute **Exercise 3 from Level 1**, but parameterizing the methods with a configuration file.

The following values are read from `config.properties`:
- `directory`: the directory to list.
- `outputFile`: the name and path of the TXT file where the results will be saved.

#### ‚úÖ What was implemented
- `DirectoryListerConfigurable`:
  - Loads configuration from `config.properties` using `Properties`.
  - Recursively lists the directory contents in alphabetical order.
  - For each entry, indicates whether it is a **directory (D)** or a **file (F)**.
  - Saves the result in a configurable TXT file instead of printing to the console.
- `config.properties` file:
  - Contains configurable values for `directory` and `outputFile`.

Example `config.properties`:
```sh
directory=src
outputFile=output.txt
```
